# protolock

Track your .proto files and prevent changes to messages and services which impact API compatibility.

## Why

Ever _accidentally_ break your API compatibility while you're busy fixing problems? You may have forgotten to reserve the field number of a message or you re-ordered fields after removing a property. Maybe a new team member was not familiar with the backward-compatibility of Protocol Buffers and made an easy mistake.

`protolock` attempts to help prevent this from happening.

## Overview

1. **Initialize** your repository: 

        $ protolock init
        # creates a `proto.lock` file

3. **Add changes** to .proto messages or services, verify no breaking changes made: 

        $ protolock status
        CONFLICT: "Channel" is missing ID: 108, which had been reserved [path/to/file.proto]
        CONFLICT: "Channel" is missing ID: 109, which had been reserved [path/to/file.proto]

2. **Commit** a new state of your .protos (rewrites `proto.lock` if no warnings): 

        $ protolock commit
        # optionally provide --force flag to disregard warnings

4. **Integrate** into your protobuf compilation step: 

        $ protolock status && protoc -I ...

In all, prevent yourself from compiling your protobufs and generating code if breaking changes have been made.

**Recommended:** commit the output `proto.lock` file into your version control system

## Install
If you have [Go](https://golang.org) installed, you can install `protolock` by
running:
```bash
go get -u github.com/nilslice/protolock/...
```

Otherwise, download a pre-built binary for Windows, macOS, or Linux from the [latest release](https://github.com/nilslice/protolock/releases/latest) page.

## Usage
```
protolock <command> [options]

Commands:
	-h, --help, help	display the usage information for protolock
	init			initialize a proto.lock file from current tree
	status			check for breaking changes and report conflicts
	commit			rewrite proto.lock file with current tree if no conflicts (--force to override)

Options:
	--strict [true]		enable strict mode and enforce all built-in rules
	--debug	[false]		enable debug mode and output debug messages
	--ignore 		comma-separated list of filepaths to ignore
	--force [false]		forces commit to rewrite proto.lock file and disregards warnings
	--plugins               comma-separated list of executable protolock plugin names
```

## Rules Enforced

#### No Using Reserved Fields
Compares the current vs. updated Protolock definitions and will return a list of 
warnings if any message's previously reserved fields or IDs are now being used 
as part of the same message.

#### No Removing Reserved Fields
Compares the current vs. updated Protolock definitions and will return a list of 
warnings if any reserved field has been removed. 

**Note:** This rule is not enforced when strict mode is disabled. 


#### No Changing Field IDs
Compares the current vs. updated Protolock definitions and will return a list of 
warnings if any field ID number has been changed.


#### No Changing Field Types
Compares the current vs. updated Protolock definitions and will return a list of 
warnings if any field type has been changed.


#### No Changing Field Names
Compares the current vs. updated Protolock definitions and will return a list of 
warnings if any message's previous fields have been renamed. 

**Note:** This rule is not enforced when strict mode is disabled. 

#### No Removing Fields Without Reserve
Compares the current vs. updated Protolock definitions and will return a list of 
warnings if any field has been removed without a corresponding reservation of 
that field name or ID.

#### No Removing RPCs
Compares the current vs. updated Protolock definitions and will return a list of 
warnings if any RPCs provided by a Service have been removed. 

**Note:** This rule is not enforced when strict mode is disabled. 

#### No Changing RPC Signature
Compares the current vs. updated Protolock definitions and will return a list of 
warnings if any RPC signature has been changed while using the same name.

## Plugins
The default rules enforced by `protolock` may not cover everything you want to 
do. If you have custom checks you'd like run on your .proto files, create a 
plugin, and have `protolock` run it and report your warnings. Read the wiki to 
learn more about [creating and using plugins](https://github.com/nilslice/protolock/wiki/Plugins).

## Contributing
Please feel free to make pull requests with better support for various rules, 
optimized code and overall tests. Filing an issue when you encounter a bug or
any unexpected behavior is very much appreciated.
